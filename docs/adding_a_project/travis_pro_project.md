## Travis Pro

If you want Travis Pro to connect via polling, you will need your Travis CI token.
You can find this by logging into [Travis CI Pro](https://magnum.travis-ci.com),
clicking your name in the top-right corner, choosing *Accounts*,
then choosing the *Profile* tab. Copy the value listed as your *Token*
into the Project Monitor *New Project* page as your **Travis Pro Token**.
