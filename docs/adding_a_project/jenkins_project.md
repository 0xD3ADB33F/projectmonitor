## Jenkins

If you want Jenkins to connect via Webhooks, you will need the
[Jenkins notification plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin).

If you want to connect to Jenkins via polling, you'll need to ensure that your Jenkins instance is accessible by the machine running ProjectMonitor.
