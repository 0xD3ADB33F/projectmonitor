# Adding a project

After logging in, click the "New Project" button and enter
the details for a build you want to display on ProjectMonitor. The "Name" and
"Project Type" are required. You will need to either connect your service via
Webhooks or polling.

To connect via Webhooks, the project settings page will display the Webhook URL
you'll need to enter in your CI instance's settings. The Webhook URL isn't generated
until after a project is created, so you'll need to select the 'Webhooks' radio button,
click 'Create', and then click the 'Edit' button for the newly-created project
to get the Webhook URL.

In order for Webhooks to work, you'll also need to make sure that the machine hosting
ProjectMonitor is accessible by the machine hosting your CI instance.

If you want to set up a project to connect via polling instead, you'll typically need
to enter the base URL, build name or ID, and your login credentials with the CI service.
